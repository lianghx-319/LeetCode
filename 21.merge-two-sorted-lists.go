 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,4]\n[1,3,4]'
 *
 * Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list
 * should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
 * Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
 * Output: []
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 *
 * Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
 * Output: [0]
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
 * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 * Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
 *
